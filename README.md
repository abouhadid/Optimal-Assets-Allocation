In portfolio construction, avoiding the concentration of all assets in one investment is vital. Asset diversification serves as an effective strategy to mitigate both systematic risk and idiosyncratic shocks. By diversifying allocations, the entire portfolio becomes resilient to the fluctuations associated with individual stocks or specific securities classes.

Modern Portfolio Theory stands out as the ideal mathematical framework for constructing a portfolio that maximizes expected returns for a given risk level. Nevertheless, a recent trend challenges this conventional approach, introducing **graph theory** as an alternative for portfolio optimization. In the finance landscape, numerous quantitative firms leverage sophisticated mathematical tools to navigate the market. The pertinent question that arises, despite the allure of its sophistication, is whether graph theory proves effective in the realm of portfolio optimization.

Repository organization: 
* the notebook [Experiments](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/Experiments.ipynb) contains the 3 main experiments we conducted to test Monte Carlo Tree Search strategies. 
* the script [MARRAKECH](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/MARRAKECH.py) contains the board game modelisation. It was inspired by the work of this [repository](https://github.com/sor8sh/Marrakech/blob/main/main.py).
* the script [strategies](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/strategies.py) contains the implementation of the 7 MCTS strategies we tested.
* the script [utils](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/blob/main/utils.py) contains different functions useful for testing the strategies.
* the folder [results](https://github.com/abouhadid/Monte-Carlo-Search/tree/main/results) contains the .pkl files ready to be loaded and plotted.
